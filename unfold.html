                  UNFOLD is a hypothetical conference exploring ethical responsibility and technology. 
                  Delving into the topic of diversity in the design 
                  landscape and creating a conversation around the designer's ethical role. 
                  I worked in collaboration with other graduate level students to develop
                  a cohesive branding system for the conference.

              We began by developing an identity system for our conference. 
              We brainstormed names and decided on the term unfold. We thought it 
              was an unexpected term that could represent the idea of open-mindedness 
              and diversity. We almost immediately decided on Singapore
              as our point of location, making the National Design Centre as our venue.
              We carefully selected Singapore because of its approach 
              for a multiracial, multireligious society. 
              <br><br>
              Upon settling on a name and location for our connference, we also began crafting our own folded 
              letterforms to complement with theme of UNFOLD.

                To promote the conference we designed a website to house in information about the conference including
                speakers, schedule, venue and other logistics. Since our focus revolved around diversity, we 
                incorporate multiple languages in our conference. We designed a version in english and one in mandarin.

                  Along with the website, we designed an app that could be used during 
                  the conference. The app included the schedule, floor maps
                  of the venue, speakerâ€™s information, and a location for users 
                  to access their code and redeem their meals throughout the day.

                  To further promote the conference UNFOLD, we created a social media presence on twitter,

                We imagined our venue to be reflective of our identity. Our goal was to 
                make the attendee feel welcomed, joyful, and hopeful about a diverse future
                in the design world. We incorporated our customized letters and numbers 
                into our venue space to make it festive. Afterall, our conference is a 
                celebration of diversity.
