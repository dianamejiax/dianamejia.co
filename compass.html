        <b>Project Overview:</b> Compass is an app that helps individuals discover a city’s hidden gems. 
        The app generates user routes based on the user's location and the user's selections.
        These routes consist of local favorites and niche spots.   
        <br><br>
        <b>Roles:</b> User Testing, Wireframing, Prototyping, Branding, UI/UX

                Compass is an app that helps individuals discover a city’s hidden gems.
                The idea for this project grew from past travel experiences. Some questions that came to mind were
                ‘What is near me?’ or ‘What am I missing out on?’. As I spoke to different people,
                I discovered that individuals want to experience the local life. Although 
                touristy spots are on top of the list for most travelers, it seems that individuals 
                also want to discover those hidden spots. 
                <br><br>
                I started brainstorming ideas on how I could help individuals discover those hidden sites of a city.

                  Research Phase<br>
              </div> 
              <div class="images"><img class="images-scroll" src="assets/img/compass/02.png" alt="compass"></div>
              <div class="projectDescriptions">
                During the discovery phase, I spent time researching the topic travel, 
                learning about my target audience, competitive analysis, and user 
                interviews. I focused my research on user pain points of traveling, 
                mobile influence in correlation with travel decisions, and the 
                rise of online 'near me' searches. I gathered information from article 
                readings and other platforms. 

                <br>
                <br>
                At this stage, I conducted user research and user interviews. 
                I had the opportunity to run one in Spanish. I received 
                valuable input. 
                <br><br>
            
                Research revealed that individuals want to explore as much as 
                possible but don't know how to find these hidden gems. My research 
                group consisted of travelers and adventurers. To try to cover 
                the whole spectrum, I talked to occasional travelers and constant 
                travelers. They often use applications such as google maps to get 
                from point A to point B or to find new locations. After talking 
                with some users, I found that many times those hidden locations 
                are found throug interaction with locals or word of mouth.

                The prototype phase kicked off with paper sketches. I presented 
                a total of 5 polarizing concepts to users to get an idea of 
                which ideas were a hit or miss. Based on user reactions, 
                I was able to prioritize which features were most valuable 
                and useful to users.

                After going through multiple rounds of ideation and feedback, 
                I decided to focus on user routes. I prioritized 
                features that allowed users to customize personalized routes.

                  The sitemap above illustrates the key journey of the product. 
                  Upon landing on the map, the user can activate the compass by 
                  clicking the circle button with the compass icon. Once the compass 
                  feature opens, the user can select categories of interest and 
                  the number of stops to generate a route.

                  Above, are a couple of the final screens of the compass app. The demo walks 
                  through the main flow of the product. It shows how the navigation would 
                  function and how users would be able to interact with the 'compass' throughout the experience.
