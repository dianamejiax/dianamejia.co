          Compass is an app that can help individuals discover a city’s hidden gems. Through compass, 
          individuals are able look and track down those tucked away niche spots. 
          <br><br>
          The idea for this project grew from traveling experiences. Some questions that came to mind were 
          ‘What is near me?’ or ‘What am I missing out on?’. As I spoke to different people, I discovered 
          that individuals want to experience the local life. Although touristy spots are a top on the 
          list for most travelers, it seems that individuals also want to discover those special places 
          that may be overlooked. 
          <br><br>
          After receiving valuable insights, I started brainstorming ideas in which I could help individuals 
          discover those hidden spots. My approach was to create the idea of user routes. Users would select 
          what they are interested in exploring. Based on location, a personalized route would be generated. 
          The trail would consist of spots that are local favorites, popular among previous travelers, and
          other best kept secret spots. The overall idea is to create those special moments and to allow 
          individuals to see a city from multiple perspectives.
