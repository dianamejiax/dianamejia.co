        <b>Project Overview:</b> Compass is an app that can help individuals discover a city’s hidden gems. 
        The app generates user routes based on the user's location and the selections the user 
        specifies. These routes consist of local favorites, niche spots, and other places that may 
        be under the radar.   
        <br><br>
        <b>Roles:</b> User Testing, Wireframing, Prototyping, Branding, UI/UX 
        <br><br>

                Compass is an app that can help individuals discover a city’s hidden gems.
                The idea for this project grew from traveling experiences. Some questions that came to mind were
                ‘What is near me?’ or ‘What am I missing out on?’. As I spoke to different people,
                I discovered that individuals want to experience the local life. Although 
                touristy spots are a top on the list for most travelers, it seems that individuals 
                also want to discover those special places that may be overlooked. 
                <br><br>
                I started brainstorming ideas in which I could help individuals discover those hidden spots.
                My approach was to create the idea of user routes.

                I spent time researching the topic travel. I focused my research on
                a couple of topics including the pain points of traveling, mobile 
                influence when it comes to travel decisions, and the rise of online 
                searches. I gathered information from article readings and other platforms. 
                The desk research allowed me to better understand my target audience.

                <br>
                At this stage, I also conducted a couple of interviews. One of those 
                interviews was conducted in Spanish. I received valuable input, thoughts, 
                and statements. The interviews helped me better understand the struggles 
                that travelers face when traveling.

                The prototype phase kicked off with paper sketches. I presented a total of 5 polarizing 
                concepts to users. Each prototype received insights and reactions. 
                I was able to identify which ideas were most compelling to users.

                I began building digital versions of my paper prototypes. I did a couple of lo-fi/mid-fi prototypes to test with users. I was 
                able to see which prototypes
                were most successful and which features of each prototype stood out the most to users.
                The screens on the far right, are a hybrid of the beginning rounds of prototypes. 
                In the end, these prototypes meshed into one solidified idea.

                It is important to highlight that the heart of the product is the user 
                creating a customized route. During this phase, I designed and tested 
                different UI approaches for the categories section. For the hi-fi 
                prototype, I pursued a experimental rounded navigation for users to 
                swipe through the categories.

                The sitemap highlights they key user journey of the product. Once 
                the user lands on the map, the user is able to activate the compass.  
                After the compass expands, the user can make their category 
                selections to generate their route.

                  Above, are a couple of the final screens of the compass app. 
                  The demo walks through the main flow of the product. It showcases how the navigation 
                  would function and how users would be able to interact with it.
