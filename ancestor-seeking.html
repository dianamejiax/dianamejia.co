        <b>Project Concept:</b> Ancestor Seeking is an AR game 
        prototype. The goal of our prototype is to 
        increase engagement and learning outcomes in the museum 
        space. We were inspired and influenced to create a learning
         experience that felt immersive and entertaining to visitors. 
         This encouraged us to gamify how users can learn about topics 
         like the evolution process and how species relate to one another. 
        <br><br>
        <b>Roles:</b> Concept Brainstorming, UI/UX & Graphic Design
        <br><br>
        <b>Collaborators:</b> Yao Chang, Yui Tian, and Franky Wang.

                  Ancestor seeking is an augmented reality (AR) game app that themes around the evolution 
                  process and how current species have descended from their ancestors. With the app, 
                  users are able to learn what characteristics and features specifically connect 
                  species from different time periods.

                  Upon downloading, the user will land on a selection 
                  screen where they can select an animal of their
                  choice for further exploration.

                  After the user has selected an animal, the interface will switch to camera mode 
                  in order to allow users to begin scanning.  The user can begin pointing towards 
                  the physical models on display at the museum with either a mobile or tablet device. 
                  <br><br>
                  While the user is in this mode, a hint button will appear on the screen in the left 
                  corner. The user can activate the hint to receive clues and facts about the ancestors.

                When the device comes in contact with an installation, the camera will 
                switch to AR mode and display the inner skeleton of the species. Based 
                on the user's judgment, the user can determine if both animals are 
                related to one another.

                    Our first round of testing was done with our graduate class. Based on feedback, we made 
                    iterations to our prototype for the next round of testing. We had the opportunity 
                    to take a trip to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History to 
                    conduct user testing. We were able to interact with visitors and present 
                    our idea. The images on the right were our setup. We used photographs of 
                    the models to trigger the AR experience.

                  At the beginning of each of our testing sessions, we asked each user if they had 
                  previously downloaded an app at a museum before. Majority of the users we 
                  spoke to had not.  This was a critical question that we made sure to ask 
                  considering our product would exist as an application.

                  Since we created a game product, it was essential to identify the level of 
                  difficulty of the game among users across different age ranges. All users 
                  that we tested with, successfully completed the game. We were also able to 
                  identify areas of uncertainty. It was a great opportunity to learn which 
                  areas required further improvement.
